> A curated list of resources related to anti-virtualization techniques containing references to books, papers, blog posts, and other written resources.

Anti-virtualization techniques are used to detect and evade virtualized environments. These techniques are used by malware authors, anti-cheats and proprietary software among others to avoid detection by security researchers and analysts.

We generally divide anti-virtualization techniques (also called anti-VM or redpills) into 4 categories:

- **Timing-based**: These techniques rely on the fact that virtualized environments have different timing characteristics than physical machines.
- **Behavior-based**: These techniques rely on the fact that virtualized environments have different behaviors than physical machines.
- **Signature-based**: These techniques rely on the fact that virtualized environments have different signatures than physical machines.
- **Based on a trusted third party**: These techniques rely on the fact that virtualized environments have a trusted third party that can be used to detect them.

These techniques can be called redpills because they are used to detect the "red pill" of a virtualized environment. The term "red pill" comes from the movie "The Matrix" where the red pill is used to wake up the protagonist from the virtual world.

> The red pill is a special case of the related "trusted computing" and the attestation concept (Zaidenberg et al. 2015d), In Trusted computing attestation a remote 3rd party or even local software tries to ensure the integrity of the local machine in terms of software (mainly) and hardware (sometimes).
